They are important so that the data can be accessed and modified.\n","\n","2)\tExplain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n","-\tMutable data type structure means the datatype structure can be changed.\n","-\tEx –\n","List=[a,b,c,d]\n","The elements in the list can be changed\n","List[0]= “e”\n","\n","Immutable data type means we cannot change anything in the data\n","\n","Ex- name= “Shanu”\n","We cannot change anything in this datatype after it is created\n","\n","Name[0]= “Shanu” will give an error\n","\n","3)\t What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python.\n","\n","-\tList is and mutable datatype where as tuple is an immutable datatype\n","-\tSyntax – list syntax is list=[a,b,c]\n","-\tSytax for tupple is tp= (1,2,3)\n","\n","4)\tDescribe how dictionaries store data\n","Dictionaries store the data in key and a value pair\n","Ex – dict= {“student”: “Atul”, “age”:10}\n","\n","5)\tWhy might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","\n","6)\tWhat is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","\n","-\tString is the sequence of the characters  example – “Pw Skills” which can be used to create dictionaries, list or any data type. Whereas list is the collection of any datatype and string can be used to create a list\n","\n","7)\t How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","\n","8)\tWhat is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","\n","9)\tCan lists contain different data types in Python ?\n","\n","-\tYes list can contain different data types in python\n","Ex- lst= [42, \"hi\", 4.1, True,]\n","\n","10)\t Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n","\n","11)\tWhat advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","\n","-\tDictionaries allow access to some data by their keys and values where as lists are used where we need to iterate or update the data stored.\n","\n","12)\tDescribe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","\n","13)\tHow do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","\n","-\tSets automatically handle the duplicate value by ignoring the new duplicated value in the set as it ignores the new value and count the original one\n","\n","14)\tHow does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","-\t“in” keyword in list – check for the member present in the list or not\n","-\t“in” keyword in dictionaries – check for the member present by the key\n","\n","15)\tWhat is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","-\tA nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values can themselves be dictionaries.
